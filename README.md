<h3>DataCoLab data science intern position technical assessment.
</h3>
<h2 align="center">Objective: </h2>

<p>Creating a Python script or notebook that combines NLP, Computer Vision, 
Machine Learning, and Data Visualization to analyze and understand a 
dataset of book summaries. This involves cleaning the data, exploring its 
characteristics through EDA, shortening the summaries, and transforming them into images.</p>

<h2 align="center">Requirements:</h2>

<h3>1. Data Preprocessing and EDA:</h3>
<p>- Clean the data by handling missing values.</p>
<p>- Explore the dataset to understand its characteristics.</p>

<h3>2. NLP Component:</h3>
<p>- Condense the book summaries to make them shorter.</p>

<h3>3. Computer Vision Component:</h3>
   <p>- Convert the condensed text summaries into images
using a Text-to-Image model.</p>

<h2 align="center">Output:</h2>

<h3>The repo provides:</h3>
<p>- The condensed text summaries.</p>
<p>- The converted images.</p>
- The findings from the exploratory data analysis.
